# Paragraph Examples
This is my first try to write a paragraph.
This is my second attempt.

The quick fox jumped over the lazy dog
but the dog got hurt
and the fox died.



The lazy dog was sleeping, and the quick fox jumped over the dog.

Let's try header levels. there is a limit of maximum 6 levels.
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

#### Header 4


##### Header 5

###### Header 6
####### Header 7
This shows that there is a limit of 6 levels.
One more thing to note here is that multiple spaces are combined and reduced to a single line space.
# Emphasis
Like it or not, the _quick_ fox was not as *quick* as the lazy dog. For italics, we can use any of the two, single underscore or single asterisk on each side of the word.

Similarly for bold, we can use double underscore or asterisk. Always try to be __bold__, not really that kind of **bold**.
